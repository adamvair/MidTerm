Single player Battleship made in C# using Visual Studio 2015.

One class for drawing a visual board for the player to see and to keep track of their hits and misses. Calling the class BattleshipBoard

Second class for user input to keep track of hits and misses and error checking of sorts just incase the player chooses points that don't exist on the board or inputs a string instead of a location on the board.

Our main program greets the player asks for a player namme and uses the other two classes methods to draw the game board and to show the hits and misses visually for the player and after everything is sunk tells the player they have won.
