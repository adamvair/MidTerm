Single player Battleship player vs computer generated ships made in C# using Visual Studio 2015.

One class for drawing a visual board for the player to see and to keep track of their hits and misses. We called the class BattleshipBoard

Second class to ask for user input, store it and error checking of sorts just incase the player chooses points that don't exist on the board or inputs a string instead of a location on the board. We called the class PlayerVsComputer

Our main program called Battleship greets the player asks for a player namme and uses the other two classes methods to draw the game board and to show the hits and misses visually for the player and after everything is sunk tells the player they have won.
